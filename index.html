                <p>Hi, we are Simply Sleep - a student targeted sleep and habit tracker that not only tracks sleep, but enables tracking of sleep affecting habits such as caffeine and exercise. 
                    <br><br>Unlike other competing apps, Simply Sleep will then offer recommendations for how you can achieve a routine fit for you.
                    <br><br>Discover what affects your sleep - from weather to screentime - and receive advice tailored for you.
                    <br><br>With numerous automated and manual tracking features, finding your ideal routine has never been easier!

                           As part of a 4 person group, we developed 2 elevator pitches for our potential project
                           <br>The Simply Sleep app won out and we began carrying out user research
                           <br>During this time I created a blog to summarise our progress as a group: <a href="https://galbakor.github.io/UX-Blog/" target="_blank style="color: rgba(138, 187, 230);">Falcon UX Blog</a>

                           We interviewed each other, flatmates, family and/or friends and pooled our data together

                        <p>
                           For our SWOT competitor analysis, I researched 4 different highly rated sleep apps
                           <br>Two were highly data driven, one assisted sleep with white noise and sleep stories, the fourth was a screen filter app
                           <br> The two data driven apps left the user to figure out their own plan and locked the most important features behind paywalls
                           <br> The sleep assister and screen filter apps helped with one aspect, but not the others
                        </p>

            <section class="tightcentersection"><h2>Group Stage</br><h3>From ideation to interviews</h3></h2>
                <p>The groupwork stage consisted of 6 main stages. <br><br>
                    I recorded our group's progress in a separate blog:<br><br>
                    <a href="https://galbakor.github.io/UX-Blog/" target="_blank style="color: rgb(138, 187, 230); font-size: 2rem;">Falcon UX Blog</a>
                    <br><br>The first stage was ideation, whereby a padlet was created with the intent to brainstorm a series of user groups and issues that we thought had space for a new app.
                    <br><br>Following this, we chose the two issues that we felt were the most promising and developed elevator pitches. Of the two, one was then chosen to move forward with.
                    <br><br>With our pitch in mind, we interviewed participants from a previous sample group to acquire user needs.
                    <br><br>Next we drew common themes between our interviews and created three different personas, one for each area we felt the app should be able to assist with.
                    <br><br>After that, we outlined what the app should accomplish and how through user journey maps.
                    <br><br>Finally, we performed SWOT analysis on several popular apps that our app would be contending with in order to better understand the market space.
